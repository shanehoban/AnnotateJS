# whereClick - Paint/Annotate on any Website
A small JavaScript script that allows you to paint on any website, in three different colours!

I recommend you use the `whereClick.animationFrame.js` or `whereClick.js` where possible - as this does not require jQuery. The animation frame perhaps slightly imrpoves the performance of the drawing.

#### How To Test Drive

You can copy and paste the contents of `whereClick.animationFrame.js` into your console and start drawing (or make it a bookmarklet).

- The default colour is Red
- Hold shift before clicking for Green
- Hold ctrl before clicking for Blue
