# whereClick
A small JavaScript script that allows you to paint on any website, in three different colours!

I recommend you use the `whereClick.animationFrame.js` or `whereClick.js` where possible - as this does not require jQuery. The animation frame perhaps slightly imrpoves the performance of the drawing.
