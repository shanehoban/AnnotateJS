# WhereClick - Paint/Annotate on any Website
A small JavaScript script that allows you to paint on any website, in three different colours!

I recommend you use the `whereClick.animationFrame.js` or `whereClick.js` where possible - as this does not require jQuery. The animation frame perhaps slightly imrpoves the performance of the drawing.

### WhereClick with Canvas `whereClick.canvas.js`

**To change colour:**
  - b = blue
  - c = cyan
  - g = green
  - o = orange
  - p = purple
  - r = red
  - v = violet
  - y = yellow

### WhereClick without Canvas

#### How To Test Drive

You can copy and paste the contents of `whereClick.animationFrame.js` into your console and start drawing (or make it a bookmarklet).

- The default colour is Red
- Hold shift before clicking for Green
- Hold ctrl before clicking for Blue
